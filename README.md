The changes corresponding to these spells as well as Plant Shape I, II and III were also applied to druid wildshape ability.


In addition mod also makes some changes to existing features to make them closer to pnp:
- nerfs animal compnions to make them closer to pnp (reduces physical prowess bonuses by factor of 2, natural ac bonuses by 1.5, and removes
enchanced attacks).
- sets base skill points of every classes to 1/2 of pnp value (since most skills in the game correspond to 2 skills in pnp),
- replaces favored enemy for Sacred huntsmater with animal focus as per pnp,
- fixes Magic Vestment spell to work as per pnp rules,  
- Legendary proportions increases size by only one category and changes Natural Armor bonus to untyped (instead of enchancement),

- All flying creatures are immune to difficult terrain and ground based buff effects.
